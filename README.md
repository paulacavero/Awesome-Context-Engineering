> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This repo is both a public collection and a learning process. Expect ongoing edits and new entries.

> 🧭 **Note on categorization:** Many tools listed here could fit into multiple categories (e.g., prompting, evaluation, orchestration). I've placed each in the section where I believe it provides the most value or has its primary use case.
