📚 Context Construction & Few-shot Design

Tools that help you structure and compose rich, dynamic inputs for LLMs. Includes prompt templates, few-shot injection, context modularization, and logic-aware design.

---

### [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) – Declarative LLM framework by Stanford  
Define context-aware reasoning modules instead of writing raw prompts. Includes automatic few-shot injection and programmatic prompt composition.  
💡 Ideal for context construction, chaining, and reuse. OSS (Apache 2.0).


### [Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance) – Templating + control for prompt generation  
Define prompts with embedded variables, logic (if, for, match), and output guidance inside a single file.  
💡 Great for building reusable, dynamic context with structured control. OSS (MIT).


### [LMQL](https://github.com/eth-sri/lmql) – Language Model Query Language  
Use a Python-like syntax to build structured prompts with variables, conditions, and constraints.  
💡 Great for dynamic context construction and few-shot logic. ⚠️ Activity is low (last update: 2 months ago).
